# OCUnit test case
Use this file template instead of Apple's "Objective-C test case class" template. An explanation of the benefits is on [Quality Coding](http://qualitycoding.org/) at [Warning: Don't Use Apple's Template for Unit Tests](http://qualitycoding.org/unit-test-template/).

# Installation
`make install` to install the templates. (You can `make uninstall` if you change your mind.) Relaunch Xcode, and you should see "OCUnit test case" listed in the File Template Library in the Utilities pane â€” one for iOS, and one for OS X. You can also find them in the "New File" templates under Cocoa Touch and Cocoa.
